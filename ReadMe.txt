Imprtant-Note:   
	To check the sign up functionality kindly enter "http://localhost:3001/SignUp" as url in browser

Explanation:
	why I have done like this?
	
	Reason:
		Sir Actullay at main page which is accessed by hitting "http://localhost:3001" in the browser no space was left
		left to create a separate button for sign up, so I have used BrowserRouter as Router to to route to 
		"http://localhost:3001/SignUp" to check sign up functionality and route to "http://localhost:3001"
		to check normal get functionality of getting data from node js server which in turn reads it from json 
		file.	

server side code is in web-assignment3 folder.

react js frontend code is in react-assignemt2 folder.
